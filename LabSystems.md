# Lab Systems

The class will be divided into teams of three.  This will reduce the load on the system given the size of the class.

Each student will have their own Db2 Warehouse VM instance base on Ubuntu.   This VM will also house Harmony Profiler and Cisco VPN preconfigured to access the IBM Partner IBM Integrated Analytics System (IIAS).   

For the Migration lab we will use  Netezza Emulator hosted on Skytap.
For the Object Create and Load Lab all content is located on the Virtual Machine
For the Administration lab, you will use the VPN access on the VM to access the Partner IIAS system.
For the DSX Lab, you will use the DSX Local Skytap instance.
